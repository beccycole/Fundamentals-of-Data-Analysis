# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis

## Objective

The aim of this assignment is to analyse Anscombe's quartet dataset using the Python programming language. Summary statistics have been calculated on the four datasets within Anscombe's quartet and scatter plots created in order to visualise the datasets.

## Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter notebook was created using the software package cmder for Windows. The dataset was imported, analysed and graphically visualised using Python code. The overall analysis demonstrates the importance of graphically visually data as well as calculating descriptive statistics on data - both are required.
